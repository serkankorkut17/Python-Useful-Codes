1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:02,331
<i>I have thousands of greybeards.</i>

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,171
If your greybeards can fight,
the Queen will have them.

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,090
They will fight hard,

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,009
like northerners.

5
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:17,138
Our victory depends on the
efforts of the small folk.

6
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,644
The King has promised
us some relief.

7
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,438
Did he say when?

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,478
I've decided to
send Joffrey to ward

9
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,860
<i>with my cousin,
Lady Jeyne Arryn.</i>

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,987
<i>Aegon and Viserys
will accompany him.</i>

11
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,990
I need you to be the mother
to them that I cannot.

12
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,492
<i>Guard them as a dragon
guards her eggs.</i>

13
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:39,164
Do you accept me as
your Queen and ruler?

14
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,662
<i>Or do you cling even now
to what you think you lost?</i>

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,210
<i>You've come here after
quarreling with your wife.</i>

16
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,294
I mean, does it please you that
her legitimacy is contested

17
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,509
<i>as you stand here with
a castle and a dragon?</i>

18
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,401
Ser Willem Blackwood of
House Blackwood, Your Grace.

19
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,968
Once you and your dragon

20
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,350
bring the Queen's
justice to the Brackens,

21
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,185
our armies will be yours.

22
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,396
<i>Cole is already
preparing his attack.</i>

23
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,733
<i>The two of you
have been plotting</i>

24
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,485
without my authority.

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,028
<i>They don't care what I think.</i>

26
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,984
Do you think simply
wearing the crown

27
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,239
imbues you with wisdom?

28
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,703
Cole marches on Rook's Rest.

29
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,330
- Send me.
- No.

30
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,667
<i>You must send me, Your Grace.</i>

31
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,710
This was your secret plot, Cole?

32
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,420
<i>For the King himself
to lay ambush</i>

33
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,168
<i>and mayhaps die in the attempt.</i>

34
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,340
No!

35
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,593
Thank the gods!

36
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,428
<i>Dracarys!</i>

37
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,389
No!

38
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,893
<i>Where is His Grace?</i>

39
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,809
- Only one.
- That's enough, stand back.

40
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,276
Behold!

41
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,946
The traitor dragon Meleys!

42
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:26,238
Slain at Rook's Rest

43
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,952
by your king!

44
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,577
To Aegon!

45
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,301
- It can't be...
- They killed a dragon!

46
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,429
Mark my words, this
is a black omen.

47
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,825
Rhaenyra will answer this.

48
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,327
'Tis an abomination.

49
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,872
Don't they realize
we won the battle?

50
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,959
Strange victory...

51
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,332
if it was one.

52
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,981
Behold!

53
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,814
The traitor dragon Meleys!

54
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,649
I thought the dragons was gods.

55
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,194
Slain at Rook's
Rest by your king!

56
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,208
It's just meat.

57
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,891
Is he alive?

58
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,018
His Grace...

59
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,063
remains with us, for the moment.

60
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,033
Is my son going to die?

61
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,872
I'm afraid I cannot say.

62
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,539
Now, if you'll excuse me, Your Grace,
these next hours are most critical.

63
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,752
Of course.

64
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,434
Easy as you can.

65
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,415
Someone will have to
rule in his stead.

66
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,270
- What happened?
- We took the castle.

67
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,027
At the cost of some 900 men.

68
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,447
So I've heard.

69
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,701
I left a meager garrison
behind to protect it

70
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,329
and the king's dragon.

71
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,498
Sunfyrewas long in the dying.

72
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,334
The king, Ser Criston,
what befell him?

73
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,548
His Grace fought valiantly.

74
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,889
And Aemond?

75
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,190
What was his part in this?

76
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,029
I could not say.

77
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,203
Our largest dragon
has been killed.

78
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,708
Criston Cole marches about
the Crownlands unchallenged.

79
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,336
Duskendale and
Rook's Rest are gone.

80
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,002
We still have no ground army

81
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:39,005
but the one we hope
that Daemon will raise.

82
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:43,175
He who has left us...
after some marital spat.

83
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,392
Do you take issue
with me, Ser Alfred?

84
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,105
My loyalty to you
is proven, my queen.

85
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,353
Your loyalty, perhaps,

86
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,189
but your willingness to give
me deference in a time of war.

87
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,359
I could never doubt
your capability,

88
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,283
or your quickness of mind.

89
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,365
It is merely that
the gentler sex,

90
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,788
heretofore, has
not been much privy

91
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,746
to the strategies of battle,

92
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,710
or their execution.

93
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,043
There has been peace
in our lifetime.

94
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,591
You've seen no more
battles than I have.

95
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,942
Send to Maidenpool and
to Crackclaw Point.

96
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,110
Let them man their garrisons

97
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,737
and give them stores or weapons

98
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,284
if they find them wanting.

99
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,783
If Cole pursues his campaign,

100
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:52,078
- our allies must be ready.
- We must answer Rook's Rest,

101
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,413
- and Duskendale.
- They are lost already.

102
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,957
But Vhagar is
depleted after such

103
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,129
a hard-fought battle.

104
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,418
If Aegon is dead...

105
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,795
We will soon know it.

106
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,755
'Twould be a victory
in name only.

107
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,924
They will soon prop up
another in his stead.

108
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,137
The time is ripe.

109
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,502
If we can strike King's Landing

110
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,095
before their dragon
is recovered...

111
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,642
Then I myself must do it.

112
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,308
My queen, you are the crown.
It is out of the question.

113
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,936
What would you have me do?

114
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,546
Jace?

115
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,466
Where are you going?

116
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,968
To Harrenhal. To
treat with Daemon.

117
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,344
Rhaenys is fallen.

118
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,225
He must affirm his
loyalty to my mother

119
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,352
and report his standing.

120
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,357
And you think you
will tame him...

121
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,067
when the queen
herself could not?

122
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,983
My mother gladly sends you away

123
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,818
to scout, to fight,

124
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,908
whilst I'm here being forced
to play the coddled princeling.

125
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:13,246
- It's humiliating, Baela.
- She only protects you.

126
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,706
You are the succession.

127
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,877
Then I must be seen to act
for her claim and mine.

128
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,258
I can sit still no longer.

129
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,387
I must act.

130
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,396
The Freys.

131
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,730
They control the
crossing at the Twins.

132
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,566
Cregan Stark's graybeards
are marching south.

133
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,903
If his men had a direct
route into the Riverlands,

134
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,034
we would not have to
wait for Daemon to act.

135
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,412
I will treat with The
Freys to secure it.

136
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,247
She will not like it.

137
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,627
Then don't tell her.
Not until I'm away.

138
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,935
The hour is late and
my dragon is hungry.

139
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,393
You have no choice
but to submit.

140
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,269
Our terms are
simple, Lord Bracken.

141
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,985
Renounce the false
king Aegon as a usurper

142
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,780
and bend the knee to me

143
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,569
or your house burns.

144
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,618
I would sooner be the
Lord of Bones and Cinders

145
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:38,077
than bend my knee before some
heathen Blackwood cunt...

146
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,666
and his hired dragon.

147
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,292
The Brackens were a
people hatched out

148
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,749
of the deepest of the
Seven Hells, Your Grace.

149
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,292
It would be a kindness
to oblige them

150
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,294
and send them back
whence they came.

151
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,587
Did your brother's head

152
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,136
keep on its way
back to you, Willem?

153
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,346
I heard the maggots got to it.

154
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,474
That is quite the
impression, Lord Bracken.

155
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,519
But alas, not an answer.

156
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,531
We choose fire.

157
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,794
I did not think they
would be so eager to die.

158
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,380
They made their choice.

159
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,671
- You should've indulged them.
- I need them alive.

160
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,636
I came here to raise
swords, not corpses.

161
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,345
But now you see what my house
has known for generations.

162
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,351
They are pigheaded,
intransigent...

163
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,020
They would rather
burn than succumb.

164
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,859
Exactly the kind of men I need.

165
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,359
It may yet be possible, I think,

166
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,406
for both of us to
achieve our ends.

167
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,197
We have fought them
for an age and more.

168
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,656
Then perhaps you could try

169
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,038
less fighting and more...

170
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,585
persuading.

171
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,089
They are unyielding in battle.

172
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,678
But every man has a weakness.

173
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:21,184
You take my meaning, then.

174
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,900
There are things the crown
itself must not been seen to do.

175
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,736
Show them your worst.

176
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,193
I am your servant, Your Grace.

177
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,926
<i>Over the centuries,
many and more armies</i>

178
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,225
have broken themselves
against my bloody gate.

179
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,606
Are you listening?

180
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,775
My lady.

181
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,945
The Eyrie itself is impregnable.

182
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:19,451
Unless, of course, we're
descended upon from the sky.

183
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,241
You promised the Queen
Rhaenyra 15,000 swords...

184
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:25,498
In return for
protection. A dragon.

185
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,836
Then she has
exceeded your terms.

186
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,129
She sent two.

187
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,174
Both still wet from the egg.

188
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,345
I have hunting hounds
that are more fearsome.

189
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,805
They are dragons nonetheless.

190
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,595
I do not recall you specifying

191
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,309
the size of the beast
in your request.

192
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,311
Will you goad me, child?

193
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,814
When your bread and shelter
now depend on my pleasure?

194
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,526
The dragons will grow...

195
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,696
- in time.
- I don't have time.

196
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,825
I mislike feeling powerless.

197
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,661
So do I.

198
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:11,957
This will be your chamber.

199
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,172
I'll expect you at
supper this evening?

200
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,346
My sympathies for the
death of your grandmother.

201
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:32,311
The way they spoke at
my small council today.

202
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:35,815
Do they hold you responsible
for Rhaenys and her dragon?

203
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,529
I would rather they had.

204
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,740
They speak around me, not to me.

205
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,655
They would make me queen,

206
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,824
but they wish to keep
me here, confined.

207
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,372
They betray their own smallness.

208
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,207
In truth, I cannot fault them.

209
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:53,499
I am now the sovereign.
I cannot do as I please.

210
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:56,210
And war has ever
been for men to make.

211
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:59,714
You are your father's
chosen successor.

212
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:02,174
He did not prepare me to fight.

213
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,055
If I had been a son,

214
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,726
a sword thrust into my hand
the moment I could walk.

215
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,520
Instead, I was given
my father's cup...

216
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,606
taught the name of
every lord and castle

217
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,187
between Storm's
End and the Twins,

218
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,403
but not the difference
between hilt and foible.

219
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,072
And they know it.

220
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:26,032
- And Daemon as well...
- Shall your evening meal be served here, Your Grace?

221
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,746
Not now.

222
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,295
Will you send to him?

223
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,545
For too long, I have
looked to him for strength.

224
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,634
If I must be supplicant
to my own husband,

225
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,595
what does that make me?

226
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,143
I do not know my part, Mysaria.

227
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,940
The path I walk has
never been trod.

228
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,737
Criston Cole made a mistake.

229
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:06,405
Parading a dragon's head through
the streets like a prize of war,

230
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,449
but the people see an ill omen.

231
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:09,950
Yes, as do I.

232
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:13,287
They are afraid,
bread is scarce,

233
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,747
the king has fallen,

234
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,337
they whisper to each other
that when Viserys lived,

235
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,585
there was peace.

236
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:22,342
But will whispers
tear down stone...

237
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,843
or break shields?

238
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:27,347
Do not underestimate
your subjects.

239
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:28,973
They are a thousand-thousand

240
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,763
living in the shadow
of the Red Keep

241
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,311
and forgotten for too long.

242
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,189
And you think they
will turn to me.

243
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:40,819
To the discontented,
rumors are feed.

244
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,117
Your Grace.

245
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:53,832
What you cannot do,
let others do for you.

246
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,290
There is more than one
way to fight a war.

247
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,982
The thought of her
lying in a field,

248
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,864
broken amongst her enemies.

249
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:40,420
Did your grandmother ever tell you
of the night she claimed Meleys?

250
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,423
She snuck into the Dragonpit.

251
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:46,551
She knew that place
better than any Elder.

252
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,220
They say she could
see in the dark.

253
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,557
My father was furious.

254
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,680
His own mother's dragon,

255
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:56,061
the fastest beast ever known,

256
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,017
and she'd have none of him.

257
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,523
But bent her neck to Rhaenys.

258
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,735
She was fierce...

259
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,072
in love and in anger.

260
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:13,286
She did not always
care for me, but...

261
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:19,125
for what she gave me in
the end, I'm grateful.

262
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:28,051
I wished I had known
her when she was young.

263
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:37,936
You are very like
her in some ways.

264
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:45,398
And with her gone... I
must rely on you, I think.

265
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,067
Your Grace?

266
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,824
Would you give this
to your grandsire?

267
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,963
I do not wish to stand alone.

268
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,427
Daemon.

269
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,516
<i>Daemon.</i>

270
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:20,145
<i>You were always the strong one.</i>

271
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,816
The finest swordsman...

272
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,155
the fearless dragon rider.

273
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:35,702
<i>Your brother had great
love in his heart...</i>

274
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,334
<i>...but he lacked
your constitution.</i>

275
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,962
<i>Viserys was unsuited
for the crown...</i>

276
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:53,053
<i>but you... Daemon, you
were made to wear it.</i>

277
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:16,368
<i>If only you'd been born first.</i>

278
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:20,038
My favorite son.

279
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:29,589
Is the duck not to your
liking, Your Grace?

280
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:38,181
There's also goose,
if you'd prefer it.

281
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,722
I like the goose, myself.

282
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,403
Uh, I'm not hungry.

283
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,738
I was saying, given
the rather dire news

284
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,699
from Rook's Rest...

285
00:26:56,533 --> 00:27:00,533
it appears the winds have shifted and
each side has suffered great loss,

286
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:04,124
and will be unsure
of what is to follow.

287
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,207
A good time, then, for
a show of strength.

288
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,375
I believe Willem Blackwood

289
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:12,048
is bringing House
Bracken to heel.

290
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:16,636
We must ready the castle
to receive a great host.

291
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,761
You seem sure of this.

292
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,556
All men may be led, Ser Simon.

293
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,311
Even Rivermen.

294
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:30,275
'Tis a matter of showing them
whom it behooves them to follow.

295
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:33,778
How does the work here progress?

296
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:37,903
Oh, um... we're drawing
water for the kitchens

297
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:40,285
- and lighting the forges.
- Very well.

298
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,908
That is merely the
beginning, of course.

299
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,664
The roof alone
has needed tending

300
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:45,745
since the reign of Aenys.

301
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:46,954
And the storerooms.

302
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,002
And...

303
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,629
and the Wailing Tower.

304
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,632
The bats have made the
corridors almost impassable

305
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:56,760
with the quantity of their...

306
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,346
Their shit.

307
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,350
I venture there are
smiths and armorers

308
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,931
to be found near
Nutton and Riverbend.

309
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,979
Well, send for them,
and levy the farmers

310
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,106
from Antlers to High Heart.

311
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:14,152
Task their huntsmen to
bring us meat and wood.

312
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:16,942
Um, there is, of course,
the matter of payment.

313
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:23,161
After the, the tragedy
that befell his father...

314
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:29,288
Larys transferred his family's
wealth to King's Landing.

315
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,711
Is there any gold
left in your coffers?

316
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:36,508
Enough to keep this small
establishment you see fed and warm.

317
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,010
Relatively.

318
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:44,845
I... I rather thought,
Your Grace, as

319
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:48,186
emissary to the Queen

320
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:52,144
that p-perhaps she could
provide the necessary coin

321
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:55,735
- if you could only write to her.
- No.

322
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,862
Harrenhal is my command.

323
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:01,199
I shall guarantee
the payment myself.

324
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,827
Up, up.

325
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,873
Very well, Your Grace.

326
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:12,377
You should address
me as "my king."

327
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:14,379
But you're the prince.

328
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:17,048
What would you call the
husband of the queen?

329
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,838
- Well, the king...
- There it is, then.

330
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,385
...consort.

331
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:24,347
That last bit seems
unnecessary, don't you think?

332
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:32,018
The armor was Valyrian steel,

333
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:36,401
but His Grace suffered grievous
burns over much of his body.

334
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,237
He has many broken bones.

335
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:42,737
I fear there are
more injuries within,

336
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:44,743
injuries we cannot see.

337
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,580
We are grateful for your works,

338
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:49,706
Grand Maester.

339
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,376
- Has he woken?
- No.

340
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:59,299
I must admit, I'm not
sure he will ever wake.

341
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,635
I have plied my crafts
to their fullest extents.

342
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:06,931
Our king's fate lies
with the gods now.

343
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:20,445
A king cannot rule in his sleep.

344
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,947
The realm will have
noticed his absence.

345
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:27,160
Let them hear of his great
deeds at Rook's Rest.

346
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,996
But now we must name a
regent to take his place

347
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,790
until he recovers...

348
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,460
or does not.

349
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:39,251
A wise strategy, Your Grace.

350
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:40,965
A regency will assure the people

351
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:43,635
of the stability of the crown.

352
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:49,307
Did you have a candidate
in mind, Your Grace?

353
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,486
I myself served in this
role for my husband.

354
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,140
I am well-prepared
to do it again.

355
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:54,600
You played your part admirably

356
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,268
in a time of peace, Your Grace,

357
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,771
but circumstances have changed.

358
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,485
And here I had forgotten.

359
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,775
The king does not
lack for heirs.

360
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:07,822
The obvious choice is his
immediate successor, Prince Aemond.

361
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,156
Agreed.

362
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,992
Aemond is young.

363
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,958
And his lack of restraint
has already cost us dearly.

364
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:28,346
It is experience that offers
the surest path to security.

365
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:31,470
Queen Alicent ably shouldered
the duties of the realm

366
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,180
when her husband's
health failed him.

367
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,515
Experience is valuable, yes,

368
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,975
but the dowager
queen is a woman.

369
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:39,232
I am no stranger to rule or
to sitting at this council.

370
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:40,646
Aemond is a fearsome
dragon rider.

371
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,981
His skill is best
employed in the field,

372
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:44,984
but my experience is
needed here, at this table.

373
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,361
No offense was meant,
Your Grace, but...

374
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:52,537
- at a time when we must show strength.
- Lord Larys?

375
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:55,331
I agree, Your Grace. It
must be Prince Aemond.

376
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,498
What would it say if, in
response to Rhaenyra's crowning,

377
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:01,921
we raised up a woman of our own?

378
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,217
But, um...

379
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:09,508
but the Hand speaks
for the king's voice.

380
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,765
Ser Criston, what say you?

381
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:20,940
Aemond is the next in line.

382
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:24,611
It must be him.

383
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:31,368
It's agreed then.

384
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:54,933
What is our standing
in the Riverlands?

385
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:59,058
Uh, the banners of House Tully

386
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:01,268
are in disarray, Your Grace.

387
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:02,482
Prince Daemon has little hope

388
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:05,106
of fielding an army
of any size, for now.

389
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,734
We would do well to send
word to young Oscar Tully.

390
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:10,736
It's only a matter of time

391
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,114
before he inherits his
grandsire's mantle.

392
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:15,120
Tell me, Lord Strong,

393
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:16,663
how I can trust the
counsel of a man

394
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,331
who leaves the jewel
of the Riverlands

395
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,959
to be plucked by our enemy?

396
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:25,964
Your brother's host
can meet Daemon.

397
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:27,298
He should quicken its pace

398
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:28,421
and check the Rivermen

399
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:29,922
while their banners
are in disarray.

400
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,178
I shall send Lord
Jason encouragement.

401
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:35,140
- What else?
- We might turn our attention

402
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,596
to the smallfolk here
in King's Landing.

403
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,145
They have grown weary of
the Sea Snake's blockade.

404
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,313
So have we all.

405
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:43,644
Many are fleeing the city,

406
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:46,985
spreading word of
their fear and unrest.

407
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:50,276
Mm, then let the
gates be closed.

408
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:55,114
No one is to leave or enter,
save with our consent.

409
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,996
Merchants, so forth.

410
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,127
Go to your tasks.

411
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:07,335
We shall meet again
at first light.

412
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:11,468
Oh, and someone cut down
the fucking ratcatchers.

413
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,685
The city's safe no longer.

414
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:23,855
There is no food.

415
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,812
Our neighbors are
stealing from each other.

416
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,068
We must get out.

417
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,982
And where would you have us go?

418
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:32,197
North, maybe? South?

419
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:34,862
For all we know, every road
leads into the dragons' teeth.

420
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:37,369
Like the one they carted
through the streets?

421
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:42,415
You think Rhaenyra will let
such an affront go unchallenged?

422
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:48,046
We should make for Tumbleton.

423
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,090
My brother will have room.

424
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:52,050
You would have me turn beggar?

425
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:00,846
Are we not beggars already?

426
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,560
Have you been paid
for those machines

427
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:03,557
you were forced to build?

428
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:05,271
The king has promised payment.

429
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:08,400
The king has lied!

430
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:21,746
By all means...

431
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:25,959
stay and wait for his
empty promises, husband.

432
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:30,922
With them, you can feed
the mouths of ghosts.

433
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:12,255
Presumed you'd be here.

434
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,300
Seeing faithfully to the
Prince Regent's commands.

435
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:17,923
Aemond is the next in line.

436
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:21,093
- It is the order of things.
- You know what he is...

437
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:23,141
what he has somehow become.

438
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,266
Has your loyalty faded?

439
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,268
Or does it flourish
only at night

440
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:32,150
and flee the
sunrise like a moth?

441
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:37,318
What I saw at Rook's Rest...

442
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:40,784
What? What did you see?

443
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:46,831
Their armor melted.

444
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,169
There were men walking.
They were on fire.

445
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:56,841
We have given the
war to the dragons.

446
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:00,011
A dragon rider should lead us.

447
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,559
And what of justice,
of temperance?

448
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:09,854
Or is strength now
to be our only god?

449
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:17,195
So you cast me aside.

450
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:20,365
Have I not spared you?

451
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:25,995
What we must do
now is... terrible.

452
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,708
Will you preside over it?

453
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:34,170
- Is this who you are, Alicent?
- I did not ask to be spared.

454
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:39,759
And I did not give you
leave to speak my name.

455
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:54,520
Halt!

456
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:01,239
Stay back!

457
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:04,868
We've got to get out!

458
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:07,078
Somebody get him!

459
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:09,748
Stay back! No!

460
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,083
Holdfast, hold fast!

461
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,753
Stay back! Hold!

462
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:20,759
Back!

463
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:24,721
Disperse, disperse!

464
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:27,932
By order of Aemond Targaryen,

465
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:30,810
Prince Regent and
Protector of the Realm...

466
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:33,225
- Aemond?
- Does he mean the king?

467
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:35,770
- I don't know.
- You cannot keep us here!

468
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:38,731
- You are ordered to return to your homes!
- We want meat!

469
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,399
- Meat!
- Meat!

470
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,123
Stay back!

471
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:04,256
Our Lord Grover Tully has
not declared for Rhaenyra.

472
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,592
It means death to bare
steel against your liege,

473
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:08,973
as I'm sure my prince is aware.

474
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,811
And against your queen?

475
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:15,980
Hm?

476
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:23,446
Jason Lannister is
marshaling to the west.

477
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,700
We need to check him
before he reaches Riverrun.

478
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,448
That requires passage.

479
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:31,784
And if Stark's army is too slow?

480
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:33,619
The wind's rising.

481
00:39:33,623 --> 00:39:35,329
Winter is nigh upon us.

482
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,835
Our hesitance does not lie

483
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,958
in Rhaenyra as Queen,

484
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:43,337
nor in the ruminations
of Lord Tully, the oaf.

485
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:46,132
Our fear lies in Vhagar.

486
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:49,135
You fear a dragon leagues away

487
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:52,058
when mine own sits
outside your walls?

488
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:59,816
- Do you offer us your protection?
- I do.

489
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:09,196
And the protection of my uncle.

490
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,580
And Daemon, I'm sure,
has consented to this?

491
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:15,661
He will do as his
queen commands.

492
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:17,663
That does lend us some comfort.

493
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,998
Though it occurs
to me that dragons

494
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:22,505
- cannot be in two places at once.
- Or three.

495
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,344
What do you want?

496
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:33,262
Larys Strong has been
relieved of his castle.

497
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:36,770
Does the queen intend
to raise up a new lord?

498
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,525
You want Harrenhal.

499
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:06,424
For that... my mother will
want more than your crossing.

500
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:10,261
What does Her Grace desire?

501
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:15,100
Bent knees.

502
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,988
Up.

503
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,278
You were born to wield a sword,

504
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:16,449
but not so much an axe, perhaps.

505
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:18,159
There are others
who would sit idle

506
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:20,327
and wait for their claims
to be brought to them.

507
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:23,789
- That is not my way.
- Does splitting firewood justify what's followed you here?

508
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:25,833
Let it not be said
that Daemon Targaryen

509
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:28,127
failed to dirty his
hands in this war.

510
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:30,300
Oh, let me see them.

511
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:33,219
- Sit.
- Ah.

512
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:34,512
Sit!

513
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:41,307
I hear strange things
from Bracken land,

514
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:44,689
from Stone Hedge and
Lambswold and Mory.

515
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,688
There's news, then?

516
00:42:47,692 --> 00:42:49,069
News?

517
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:51,237
No.

518
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:55,988
What I hear, I hear in the wind.

519
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:59,204
Cries of anguish.

520
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,037
Children being taken
from their mothers,

521
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,999
men coming home to find
their doors unlatched...

522
00:43:07,003 --> 00:43:09,377
their wives carried away.

523
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:14,260
War is a terrible thing.

524
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:16,221
This is not war.

525
00:43:16,888 --> 00:43:19,345
These are crimes
against the innocent,

526
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,514
that any upright
man would repudiate.

527
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:24,350
Surely you haven't mistaken
me for an upright man.

528
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:29,730
The Brackens had their
chance to do as I required.

529
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:32,024
They will perhaps think
better of their decision

530
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:35,407
if their children's
lives are staked on it.

531
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:39,244
Is that the kind of
army you would raise?

532
00:43:40,036 --> 00:43:42,247
Men who hate you...

533
00:43:42,747 --> 00:43:44,370
who serve you under duress?

534
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:47,585
Well, once they agree to serve
me, I'll treat them fairly.

535
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:48,874
Set an example for the rest

536
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:50,922
of the Riverlands to follow.

537
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:53,299
And once again, in
the name of power,

538
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:56,428
it's the weak and the
women who must endure.

539
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:02,142
That fool, Aegon, is
unlike to survive.

540
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:06,479
The realm will suffer
if Aemond One-Eye rules.

541
00:44:07,939 --> 00:44:09,607
You should pray
you never meet him.

542
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:12,277
He will cut you down soon
as wish you good-day.

543
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:13,945
I'd heard the same
thing about you.

544
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,067
But I'll cross you no further.

545
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:16,614
I'm sure your tactics
are, after all,

546
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,571
approved by the queen.

547
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:26,416
She cannot succeed, Alys.

548
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:29,081
Even if I willed it to be so.

549
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:31,129
The people who support her
will not be led by her.

550
00:44:31,254 --> 00:44:33,252
They look to a man for strength.

551
00:44:33,256 --> 00:44:34,341
Who's better suited to it?

552
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:36,922
The Hightowers with
their scheming?

553
00:44:36,926 --> 00:44:39,346
Or Viserys's first true heir?

554
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:42,803
When I take King's Landing...

555
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:44,263
Rhaenyra is welcome
to join me there

556
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:46,811
and take her place by my side.

557
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:50,940
King and queen...
ruling together.

558
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:54,148
- And if you lose?
- Then I'll be dead,

559
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:56,442
and none of this
will be my problem.

560
00:44:56,446 --> 00:44:59,824
It's a pity, don't you think,
that you never knew your mother?

561
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:05,663
A message, Your Grace.

562
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:08,458
Uh...

563
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:13,380
uh, fresh news from Stone Hedge.

564
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:15,628
The Blackwoods have
overwhelmed the Brackens,

565
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:19,344
and, uh, Lord Amos has
pledged his banner to you.

566
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:21,846
House Bracken is yours.

567
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:25,975
Call Ser Willem here so that
I might congratulate him.

568
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:29,187
The Blackwoods will be
feted in these halls.

569
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:42,534
I sought you at High Tide.

570
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:45,537
I was surprised when
they said you were here.

571
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:48,707
My castle is a tomb.

572
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:52,085
Empty. Haunted.

573
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:56,089
I am sad to have missed
its highest days.

574
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:58,170
I imagine your Hall of Nine

575
00:45:58,174 --> 00:46:00,506
filled with lords and kings,

576
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,763
all eager to treat with the
legendary Lord of the Tides.

577
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:06,679
The wealth you brought back

578
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:08,014
from Yi Ti and Asshai,

579
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:11,396
inspiring awe and envy.

580
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:15,775
I wonder if any of them
knew it was all for her.

581
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:27,120
Queen Rhaenyra wishes
to name you Hand.

582
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:34,586
Even the death of my wife
does not content her.

583
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:38,965
Has she not asked
enough of my house?

584
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:42,260
It is a sign of
her great esteem.

585
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:45,139
Or does she think the
position will compensate me

586
00:46:45,263 --> 00:46:47,553
for my loss?

587
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:50,056
Pledge your peace to
King's Landing, then.

588
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,479
They will accept
it most gleefully.

589
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:57,734
Rather I would sail into
the West and be lost.

590
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:00,612
You have done so before,

591
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:03,656
at great cost to yourself
and those who loved you.

592
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:09,329
Rhaenys was not
only your wife...

593
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:11,915
not a thing to be
taken from you.

594
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:15,960
She was a Targaryen princess.

595
00:47:16,086 --> 00:47:17,291
The Queen Who Never Was.

596
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:20,086
And she flew to Rook's
Rest of her own will.

597
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,421
- In defense of her kin.
- And she died.

598
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:24,761
She died as she would
have wished to die...

599
00:47:25,303 --> 00:47:28,473
with honor, in dragon fire.

600
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:30,433
The way my mother chose...

601
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:35,480
and the way I myself
wish to meet my end.

602
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:45,778
I grieve my grandmother
who loved me

603
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,992
but I carry her on with me.

604
00:47:49,035 --> 00:47:53,665
I will see Rhaenyra ascend the
Iron Throne, as Rhaenys wished.

605
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:56,334
As Rhaenys herself should have.

606
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:01,673
You yourself may
do as you see fit.

607
00:48:05,176 --> 00:48:06,799
Granddaughter.

608
00:48:14,185 --> 00:48:17,522
I would make you my heir.

609
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:20,984
I am blood and fire.

610
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:24,654
Driftmark must pass
to salt and sea.

611
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:44,591
Your Grace.

612
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:49,596
You were correct...

613
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:53,850
in saying our best hope
of an army is with Daemon.

614
00:48:56,186 --> 00:49:01,900
And I have, perhaps, erred in
waiting for him to prove himself.

615
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:05,904
I wish you to go to Harrenhal.

616
00:49:07,572 --> 00:49:10,241
Are you removing me
from your council?

617
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:13,078
Ser Alfred...

618
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:17,411
I-I-I will not deny you have
tried my patience of late,

619
00:49:17,415 --> 00:49:19,584
or that I would prefer a council

620
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:21,252
more inclined to
champion their queen,

621
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:24,043
but...

622
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:27,380
you and your house
served my father well,

623
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:30,637
and I know you will never
accept the Hightower claim.

624
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:34,891
Not while I live, Your Grace.

625
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,227
We cannot challenge King's
Landing without the Riverlands

626
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:45,402
but I will not send a message by
raven for Daemon to disregard.

627
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:53,493
I ask you to...
reason with him.

628
00:49:53,618 --> 00:49:58,456
Find out his state of
mind and his intentions.

629
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,751
Intentions?

630
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:06,423
Whether he means to raise a
host for me or for himself.

631
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:10,468
He would not dare.

632
00:50:10,593 --> 00:50:13,471
Have you known Daemon
to lack in daring?

633
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:16,516
Go now with haste.

634
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:19,477
I'll send good men to
see to your safety.

635
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,654
Have you any message for him?

636
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:36,828
Tell him I would much like to
finish our last conversation.

637
00:50:39,205 --> 00:50:40,623
Your Grace.

638
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:18,411
Your Grace.

639
00:51:21,873 --> 00:51:26,211
What is it, Ser Simon? Is
the pudding now served?

640
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:29,255
The Riverlords have
come, Your Grace.

641
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:32,217
- They wish an audience.
- Now?

642
00:51:32,717 --> 00:51:35,220
- What godless hour is it?
- The wolf.

643
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:37,889
They are demanding
to speak presently.

644
00:52:08,753 --> 00:52:12,132
I see I must begin here
with a lesson in etiquette.

645
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:13,379
Or failing that, in proper fear

646
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:15,593
of your Targaryen master.

647
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:21,599
Is there some reason you feel
free to wake a king in his bed?

648
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:24,890
Or shall I now begin
your education?

649
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:26,225
House Bracken

650
00:52:26,229 --> 00:52:29,983
have been brought to heel at
the hands of Willem Blackwood.

651
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:33,441
- That news is stale.
- Yes.

652
00:52:33,445 --> 00:52:35,401
There have been,
um, complications.

653
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:37,903
The sacred septs
on Bracken lands

654
00:52:37,907 --> 00:52:41,327
- were looted and burned.
- As were the fields and farms.

655
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:42,787
The livestock was stolen

656
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:44,452
and our peasants
put to the sword.

657
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:47,125
They pursued the women
and the children.

658
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,581
There were works of barbarity.

659
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:52,339
Punishing Bracken for his own
treasons is one thing, aye.

660
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:55,133
- But these other acts.
- The Brackens were given their chance.

661
00:52:55,258 --> 00:52:57,757
- They would not see reason.
- The Blackwoods have exploited

662
00:52:57,761 --> 00:52:59,592
the war for the crown
to visit atrocities

663
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:02,136
- upon their old rivals.
- I have seen my fair share of their quarrels,

664
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,804
and I tell you, there
is no honor in a fight

665
00:53:03,808 --> 00:53:05,765
- such as this.
- Honor? What of common decency?

666
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:08,146
These beasts proudly carried

667
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:10,023
the banner of House Targaryen.

668
00:53:10,148 --> 00:53:11,983
Red dragon on black.

669
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:21,826
A terrible war is being
fought in these lands.

670
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:27,290
Have you looked after our girls?

671
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:36,713
We should've expected
nothing more from a man

672
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,718
who ordered the
slaughter of a child

673
00:53:38,843 --> 00:53:40,553
in his mother's arms.

674
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:45,725
That is a lie. And I will have the
man who told it brought before me.

675
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:50,689
Well, your man is half
the kingdom, my prince.

676
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:55,527
Know this, interloper:

677
00:53:56,027 --> 00:53:58,863
the Riverlands are
an ancient place,

678
00:53:58,988 --> 00:54:02,701
watched closely by the
eyes of old gods and new.

679
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:04,744
And dragon or no,

680
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:08,206
we shall not raise our
banners for a tyrant.

681
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:20,111
- Move along, lass.
- I have an errand... for the lady Mysaria.

682
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:22,447
I thought she was dead.

683
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:25,784
Would she die without
collecting her due?

684
00:55:27,285 --> 00:55:29,162
I must see an old friend.

685
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:32,957
Most people want out these days.

686
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:19,170
Elinda.

687
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:13,099
Was it worth the price?

688
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:05,902
Mummy.

689
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:24,337
Prince Jacaerys, Your Grace.

690
00:58:49,154 --> 00:58:50,488
Visenya.

691
00:58:51,322 --> 00:58:57,037
Vhagar's first rider, and the
first wielder of Dark Sister.

692
00:58:58,496 --> 00:59:00,953
I hope you do not mean
to use her as an example.

693
00:59:00,957 --> 00:59:02,663
Why shouldn't I?

694
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:05,045
W... It was a long time ago.

695
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:17,515
What is the mood at the Twins?

696
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:21,353
Did his lordship quibble?

697
00:59:23,521 --> 00:59:27,484
He wishes for the Freys
to be granted Harrenhal.

698
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,196
At war's end. Assuming.

699
00:59:33,865 --> 00:59:35,408
I'm proud of you, Jace.

700
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:38,036
You have done our
cause a great service.

701
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:43,249
Then, why do you look angry?

702
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:54,340
You chafed at being
prevented from action.

703
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:57,176
Imagine my lot. I'm a
dragon rider as well,

704
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,225
with a war being fought
over my ascension.

705
01:00:01,226 --> 01:00:03,395
And yet, I must wait here...

706
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:06,686
always prudent...

707
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:08,062
sending others to fight

708
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:10,527
and be felled in my name.

709
01:00:10,902 --> 01:00:13,279
Even you have managed
to do your part.

710
01:00:13,863 --> 01:00:15,573
You are the queen...

711
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:17,196
the tie that binds us.

712
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,031
- No harm can come to you.
- And you are my son,

713
01:00:19,035 --> 01:00:21,246
and I did not give
you leave to go.

714
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:25,792
You do not give me
leave to go to anything.

715
01:00:26,126 --> 01:00:27,373
But who else is there?
Rhaenys is dead,

716
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:29,250
and Baela cannot bear
the burden alone.

717
01:00:29,254 --> 01:00:31,919
And when Aemond comes
hunting for you?

718
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:34,255
Your dragon is young.

719
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:36,553
Will you fly before
Vhagar as Luke did?

720
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:45,395
Perhaps Daemon could...

721
01:00:48,773 --> 01:00:50,608
Daemon is not here.

722
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:54,900
And Aemond now rules
in King's Landing.

723
01:00:54,904 --> 01:00:59,238
- Is Aegon dead?
- Dead or alive, we have no answer for Vhagar.

724
01:00:59,242 --> 01:01:02,620
Aemond will not wait long to press
his advantage. And then what?

725
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:06,791
I have done all I can from here,

726
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:09,623
sent my messages,
invoked my alliances.

727
01:01:09,627 --> 01:01:12,255
But if all else fails,
it is I who must fight.

728
01:01:13,965 --> 01:01:16,756
Vhagar is big, but
Syrax is quicker.

729
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,514
- So was Meleys.
- Meleys fought two dragons and one of them is slain.

730
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:24,379
Shall I fight for my birthright?

731
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:27,312
Or shall I wait here until
we are all destroyed?

732
01:01:32,984 --> 01:01:35,153
I need dragons.

733
01:01:38,323 --> 01:01:41,493
We have no dearth of dragons.

734
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,159
We have two large enough
to stand against Vhagar.

735
01:01:45,163 --> 01:01:48,454
They are called
Vermithor and Silverwing

736
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,001
and they sleep just
beneath our feet.

737
01:01:50,126 --> 01:01:51,207
Yes, and if only
they had riders,

738
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:53,505
none could stand against me.

739
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:57,509
I would go forth in strength
and not from necessity.

740
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,053
There is Rhaena.

741
01:02:00,178 --> 01:02:03,348
Who nearly lost her life
in her last attempt.

742
01:02:04,724 --> 01:02:06,726
I would not risk it again.

743
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:15,694
There are those of our
line who never ruled.

744
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:19,906
Those who married into
other noble houses,

745
01:02:20,031 --> 01:02:22,655
their children born
with other names.

746
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:26,492
A generation ago, or more.
Their blood would be thin.

747
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:27,872
And yet...

748
01:02:28,998 --> 01:02:33,332
A dragon will only accept
a dragon lord to ride it.

749
01:02:33,336 --> 01:02:37,336
- Or so say the histories.
- Valyrian histories.

750
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,505
Written to gild us in glory.

751
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:45,015
Are you suggesting we put
a Mallister on a dragon?

752
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:49,227
- A Tarly?
- It's better than death and defeat.

753
01:02:55,025 --> 01:02:58,357
There are records here,
surely, of our line

754
01:02:58,361 --> 01:03:00,739
and of those who fell out of it.

755
01:03:08,204 --> 01:03:09,869
There could be scores of them.

756
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:19,466
It's a mad thought.

757
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:54,348
<i>It has never been
attempted before.</i>

758
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:57,564
To claim a dragon,

759
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:00,567
<i>you must also be
prepared to die.</i>

760
01:05:01,526 --> 01:05:03,194
<i>Perhaps the gods will favor us.</i>

761
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:06,652
<i>If Daemon prevails
in the Riverlands,</i>

762
01:05:06,656 --> 01:05:08,658
<i>I no longer have the
numbers to challenge him.</i>

763
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:11,202
My uncle is a
challenge I welcome,

764
01:05:11,327 --> 01:05:12,203
<i>if he dares face me.</i>

765
01:05:12,537 --> 01:05:14,537
<i>You have the arrogance of youth.</i>

766
01:05:15,373 --> 01:05:16,871
Have the indignities
of your childhood

767
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,209
not yet sufficiently
been avenged?

768
01:05:19,544 --> 01:05:22,335
<i>You must see in me a ruler
and the symbols of authority.</i>

769
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:24,090
<i>The shield and the sword.</i>

770
01:05:24,215 --> 01:05:25,713
<i>We will still never match</i>

771
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:27,214
<i>the strength of
the Green armies.</i>

772
01:05:27,218 --> 01:05:28,345
We need Daemon.

773
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,890
<i>I must now proceed
as if I stand alone.</i>

774
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,514
It is my fault that you
have forgotten to fear me.

775
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:57,078
<i>This episode is very much</i>

776
01:05:57,082 --> 01:05:59,125
everybody vying for power,

777
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:03,042
<i>but also, it's very much about
that happening through grief.</i>

778
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:08,923
Much of episode five revolves
around how Rhaenys' death

779
01:06:08,927 --> 01:06:11,592
is resonating across all of
the different characters,

780
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:15,308
<i>and no one as much as it lands
with her husband, Corlys.</i>

781
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:19,058
<i>This poor guy, over the
course of these two seasons,</i>

782
01:06:19,062 --> 01:06:21,314
<i>has slowly had every
human connection</i>

783
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:23,608
<i>stripped away from
him, one by one.</i>

784
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:25,606
He's sitting in
the Hall of Nine,

785
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:26,982
but it means nothing
to him anymore

786
01:06:26,986 --> 01:06:28,109
because she's gone.

787
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:29,902
<i>And all of this
stuff, who cares?</i>

788
01:06:29,906 --> 01:06:31,946
<i>Steve is an incredible actor.</i>

789
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:36,329
He has such deep soul to
all of his performances.

790
01:06:37,163 --> 01:06:40,162
<i>I had no clue that he
was gonna have this tear,</i>

791
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:42,168
<i>like this silent tear,
roll down his face.</i>

792
01:06:42,293 --> 01:06:44,963
It was incredibly
moving to see it.

793
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:49,676
Our largest dragon
has been killed.

794
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:53,134
Duskendale and
Rook's Rest are gone.

795
01:06:53,138 --> 01:06:54,260
I think everybody's reeling.

796
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:55,864
I mean, Rhaenyra, not
the least of which.

797
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:58,305
<i>And you hear a lot
of this backbiting</i>

798
01:06:58,309 --> 01:06:59,686
<i>and bickering going
on at the table</i>

799
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:02,518
<i>because everybody is under a
tremendous amount of stress.</i>

800
01:07:02,522 --> 01:07:03,857
<i>They don't know how to react.</i>

801
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:06,151
<i>But Rhaenyra finds
herself at sea.</i>

802
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:09,863
I mean, that was her last
great female advisor.

803
01:07:10,196 --> 01:07:12,987
<i>And that's also
when Rhaenyra sees</i>

804
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:15,031
<i>this huge power vacuum</i>

805
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:16,536
and knows she's got
to do something.

806
01:07:17,203 --> 01:07:19,205
Queen Rhaenyra wishes
to name you Hand.

807
01:07:19,664 --> 01:07:22,709
Even the death of my wife
does not content her.

808
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:24,957
She's playing the role of
the great politician here.

809
01:07:24,961 --> 01:07:27,047
The next best thing, next
to having Daemon back,

810
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:29,462
<i>is one of the most
respected men in Westeros,</i>

811
01:07:29,466 --> 01:07:30,675
<i>and that's the Sea Snake.</i>

812
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:33,507
And she doesn't exploit
Rhaenys' death to do it.

813
01:07:33,511 --> 01:07:35,843
<i>She knows that the man is
there, looking for purpose,</i>

814
01:07:35,847 --> 01:07:37,345
<i>probably looking for
a bit of vengeance,</i>

815
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:39,180
<i>and she probably takes
advantage of that in the moment</i>

816
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:40,685
to try to get him back on side.

817
01:07:42,812 --> 01:07:44,397
The path I walk has
never been trod.

818
01:07:44,564 --> 01:07:48,526
What you cannot do,
let others do for you.

819
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:51,696
There is more than one
way to fight a war.

820
01:07:52,238 --> 01:07:55,237
I think Mysaria's power
increases in Rhaenys' absence

821
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:56,697
because I think
Rhaenyra is desperate

822
01:07:56,701 --> 01:07:59,746
<i>and looking for that sympathetic
female voice in her life.</i>

823
01:08:00,246 --> 01:08:02,036
<i>Mysaria's offering
another way, which is,</i>

824
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,917
"I understand the
will of the people,

825
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:05,873
and we can manipulate that

826
01:08:05,877 --> 01:08:07,333
and play that to
your advantage."

827
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:09,422
An element of what
we're watching

828
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:10,711
is propaganda war.

829
01:08:10,715 --> 01:08:12,384
<i>How to win the
hearts of the people.</i>

830
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:15,216
And that's all learning that
she receives from Mysaria.

831
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,677
<i>I don't think this is
something that Rhaenyra</i>

832
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:18,801
<i>had thought of or considered</i>

833
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:20,725
<i>until Mysaria brought
it to the fore.</i>

834
01:08:21,017 --> 01:08:22,602
And it's a bit of
a modern concept,

835
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:25,393
this idea of the, quote-unquote,
"power of the people."

836
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:27,941
I have an errand for
the Lady Mysaria.

837
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:30,231
<i>In real history, smart
and sometimes cunning</i>

838
01:08:30,235 --> 01:08:34,193
<i>and ruthless medieval sovereigns
did use people and their will</i>

839
01:08:34,197 --> 01:08:35,444
<i>to their advantage.</i>

840
01:08:35,448 --> 01:08:36,700
Behold!

841
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,953
The traitor dragon, Meleys!

842
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:42,414
It is. Look, they've
killed a dragon.

843
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:45,083
Mark my words, this
is a black omen.

844
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:47,206
I think this is very...
this is very Cole.

845
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:49,083
<i>His expectations are so high.</i>

846
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:51,798
His expectations are
for people to honor him

847
01:08:51,923 --> 01:08:53,758
and put him up on a pedestal.

848
01:08:53,925 --> 01:08:55,256
If you look like you've won

849
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,258
and you carry yourselves
like you've won,

850
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:59,218
<i>and the public don't know
what's really happened,</i>

851
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:00,982
<i>then that's what everyone's
going to believe.</i>

852
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:02,976
But what happens
is so different.

853
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:04,894
Don't they realize
we won the battle?

854
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:07,643
Strange victory, if it was one.

855
01:09:07,647 --> 01:09:09,437
<i>The calculation
that he doesn't make</i>

856
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:11,147
is how it will land
on the small folk.

857
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:13,153
I mean, Meleys is
a beloved dragon

858
01:09:13,278 --> 01:09:15,276
<i>that probably flew over
that city hundreds of times</i>

859
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,069
<i>and is seen as one
of these symbols</i>

860
01:09:17,073 --> 01:09:18,487
<i>of the unshakableness,</i>

861
01:09:18,491 --> 01:09:20,994
<i>of the invincibility
of the Targaryens.</i>

862
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:22,450
I thought the dragons was gods.

863
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:23,784
<i>You know, as soon
as people can see</i>

864
01:09:23,788 --> 01:09:26,332
you can kill dragons, well,
then anybody can do it.

865
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,960
And that... does that mean
that these people that have...

866
01:09:29,085 --> 01:09:30,583
we've always thought
of as being gods

867
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:32,672
<i>because of their
ability to ride dragons</i>

868
01:09:33,131 --> 01:09:35,592
<i>is actually all a
bit of a mirage?</i>

869
01:09:36,634 --> 01:09:39,012
<i>This is, at best,
a terrible omen</i>

870
01:09:39,137 --> 01:09:41,639
and at worst, a harbinger
of the things to come.

871
01:09:45,977 --> 01:09:48,768
The King. Ser Criston,
what befell him?

872
01:09:48,772 --> 01:09:50,357
His Grace fought valiantly.

873
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:53,651
And Aemond? What was
his part in this?

874
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:54,986
I could not say.

875
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:58,698
<i>The dramatic tension that
looms over the episode is,</i>

876
01:09:58,823 --> 01:10:00,363
what is the state of Aegon?

877
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:03,995
<i>And did he survive the
end of episode four?</i>

878
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:06,536
<i>And will he survive through
the end of this episode?</i>

879
01:10:06,623 --> 01:10:08,120
<i>And I think that's
what's kind of looming</i>

880
01:10:08,124 --> 01:10:10,043
<i>over all these characters,
that big question,</i>

881
01:10:10,335 --> 01:10:13,129
<i>to show the cost of
letting your sovereign</i>

882
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:15,048
get on his dragon
and ride into battle.

883
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:17,213
Someone will have to
rule in his stead.

884
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:19,006
<i>I mean, it's everything
he ever wanted.</i>

885
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:21,133
With great power comes
great responsibility,

886
01:10:21,137 --> 01:10:22,889
and he's got to
be seen as someone

887
01:10:23,014 --> 01:10:24,182
<i>who knows how to wield it.</i>

888
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:26,681
I agree, Your Grace. It
must be Prince Aemond.

889
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:28,349
<i>I mean, this is a
massive power shift,</i>

890
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:29,850
all of a sudden, at
the Green Council.

891
01:10:29,854 --> 01:10:33,020
It was dramatized by the
meeting where Aemond takes power

892
01:10:33,024 --> 01:10:34,264
<i>in this very kind of banal way,</i>

893
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:36,399
<i>where he just stands up
from the foot of the table,</i>

894
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:38,150
<i>takes his ball, and moves
over to the King's seat,</i>

895
01:10:38,154 --> 01:10:39,531
<i>and puts it down, and sits,</i>

896
01:10:39,656 --> 01:10:41,195
<i>and then starts
doling out orders</i>

897
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:42,863
<i>while everybody,
including Alicent,</i>

898
01:10:42,867 --> 01:10:43,906
<i>especially Alicent,</i>

899
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:45,870
<i>are reeling from the decision.</i>

900
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:47,368
And you feel the
shift in that way

901
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:49,745
and how different the
Red Keep is going to be

902
01:10:49,749 --> 01:10:52,168
with Aemond in charge versus
the way it was with Aegon.

903
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:54,921
Someone cut down the
fucking ratcatchers.

904
01:10:56,506 --> 01:10:58,004
Our terms are
simple, Lord Bracken.

905
01:10:58,008 --> 01:11:00,760
Renounce the false King
Aegon as a usurper.

906
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:03,179
Bend the knee to me,

907
01:11:04,597 --> 01:11:05,890
or your house burns.

908
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:09,056
Daemon approaches life
always trying to hammer

909
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,225
that square peg
into the round hole,

910
01:11:11,229 --> 01:11:14,858
and he's just trying to force
his will upon this place.

911
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:18,899
I love the image of him in
his full dragon battle armor,

912
01:11:18,903 --> 01:11:19,946
sitting on the rock,

913
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,737
<i>and not understanding what's
happened, and saying...</i>

914
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:25,364
I did not think they
would be so eager to die.

915
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:28,288
And the Riverlands is just this
unwrangleable place to him.

916
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:30,077
<i>He's brought his values</i>

917
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:32,792
<i>and sort of Targaryen
dragon lord values</i>

918
01:11:32,917 --> 01:11:34,123
<i>into a place that is rich</i>

919
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:35,750
<i>with the old gods
and these old ways.</i>

920
01:11:35,754 --> 01:11:38,377
These people just don't
respect the dragon lords

921
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:40,592
<i>the way Daemon is
hoping or used to.</i>

922
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:43,261
I see I must begin here
with a lesson in etiquette.

923
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:46,886
On the page, I thought, "Yeah,
this is the right territory.

924
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:49,221
This is where we should be.
This is where his head's at."

925
01:11:49,225 --> 01:11:51,557
<i>It's how mental his
kind of state is.</i>

926
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:54,477
<i>Is Daemon trying
to usurp Rhaenyra?</i>

927
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:57,650
It's, like, unfair that
he wasn't given the crown,

928
01:11:57,776 --> 01:12:00,107
that he isn't listened to,

929
01:12:00,111 --> 01:12:01,988
<i>that he doesn't have that power.</i>

930
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:03,944
We just don't know
what he's going to do

931
01:12:03,948 --> 01:12:06,322
or, ultimately, how
he's going to turn.

932
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:08,783
<i>And while I don't think that
anybody could ever be asked</i>

933
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:11,285
<i>to believe that he would
turn against Rhaenyra</i>

934
01:12:11,289 --> 01:12:12,791
<i>and, like, go to
war against her,</i>

935
01:12:12,957 --> 01:12:15,289
I think we could all believe
that maybe Daemon would just go

936
01:12:15,293 --> 01:12:17,124
and claim the throne for himself

937
01:12:17,128 --> 01:12:18,254
and then see what happens.

938
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:20,340
What would you call the
husband of the Queen?

939
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:22,588
- Well, the King...
- There it is, then.

940
01:12:22,592 --> 01:12:23,635
...consort.

941
01:12:25,178 --> 01:12:27,514
That last bit seems
unnecessary, don't you think?
